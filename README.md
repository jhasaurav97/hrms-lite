# HRMS Lite

HRMS Lite is a lightweight, web-based Human Resource Management System built as part of a full-stack coding assignment.  
It simulates a basic internal HR tool that allows an admin to manage employee records and track daily attendance using a clean and professional interface.

The focus of this project is on **core functionality, stability, and production readiness**, rather than excessive features.
